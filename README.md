# Steps 
\
These are the steps for running your code.

# 1. Get an IDE (I will be showing steps for CS50 IDE and CLion)

Go to either https://ide.cs50.io, or to https://jetbrains.com/clion/. For CLion, you will have to download the application, whereas in CS50 IDE, it is a web-based IDE, so, I recommend for you all to use the CS50 IDE, if you don't want to go through a lot of trouble to setting up the applications and terminal. ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Œ

** Note : In CS50 IDE, you will have to login/sign-up for a Github account. 

# 2. Upload File (for CS50 IDE and CLion)

In CS50 IDE, go to the "File" section at the top right-hand corner and click on "Upload Local Files". If you have not already have downloaded the Calculator file, please do. Once you click on "Upload Local Files", select the Calculator file and press "Open". Good job! The file has been successfully added into your CS50 IDE.

In CLion, in the start opening, press on "Open" and click on the Calculator file. Afterwards, press on "Open" using the File Explorer so it uploads to CLion.

# 3. Run The Program (for CS50 IDE and CLion)

In CS50 IDE, (for Versions 0.1 and below in BETA) you have to go to the terminal and use the command : make calculatorv0.2; then use this command : ./calculaorv0.2 or whichever your file name is, to run your program. 

In CLion, click on the Green Start Button. 

** Please Feel Free to comment me about any bugs and/or issues in this program.
